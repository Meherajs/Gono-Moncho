## About The Project

Gono Moncho addresses critical challenges in modern journalism:

- **Censorship Resistance**: Decentralized publishing protects journalists from government oppression
- **Misinformation Combat**: Community-driven verification reduces fake news spread
- **Transparent Credibility**: On-chain voting and verification create accountable journalism
- **Permanent Storage**: Integration with Arweave ensures news cannot be deleted or altered

### Core Components

- **Dual-Token Economics**: NEWS (governance) + CRED (reputation) tokens
- **DAO Governance**: Community-driven decision making through NewsDAO
- **Role-Based Access**: Reporters, Analyzers, and Verifiers with distinct responsibilities
- **Decentralized Storage**: Permanent article storage via Arweave
- **Multi-Layer Verification**: Community voting and stake-weighted credibility scoring

- [x] Basic DAO governance structure
- [x] Frontend scaffolding with Next.js
- [x] MetaMask integration
- [x] Contract deployment to Polygon Amoy testnet

### Phase 2: Core Features 🚧 (In Progress)
- [x] Reporter registration interface
- [ ] Complete verification workflow
- [ ] On-chain article publishing
- [ ] Community voting mechanism
- [ ] Stake-weighted credibility scoring
- [ ] DAO proposal creation & voting interface

### Phase 3: Advanced Features 📋 (Planned)
- [ ] Zero-Knowledge proof integration
- [ ] AI credibility analysis
- [ ] Production Arweave integration
- [ ] Mobile responsive optimization
- [ ] Comprehensive security auditing

### Known Limitations

The following limitations exist in the current implementation:

- **Testing Mode Active**: Some operations bypass stake requirements for demonstration purposes
- **Mock Arweave**: Currently using mock API endpoints; production Arweave integration planned
- **Limited Verification**: Simplified verification workflow for testing; full multi-layer system in development
- **UI Polish**: Some components require additional refinement and error handling
- **ReporterRegistry**: Requires deployment for full reporter functionality

We're actively working to address these limitations and welcome community contributions.
